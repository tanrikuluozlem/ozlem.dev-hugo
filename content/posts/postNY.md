title = "Speed Up Your Code Search with git log -S: A Time-Saving Tip"
description = "When I’m working with a large codebase, finding specific changes can take a lot of time. The git log -S command is useful in this case. It allows me to search through commits for a specific keyword in the code itself—not just in the commit messages.
By running git log -S <keyword>, I can quickly identify all the commits where the keyword was added or removed. Then, I can check out the commit I need with git checkout <commit-id>.
This command helps me track down code changes more efficiently without having to manually sift through each commit in the codebase."
